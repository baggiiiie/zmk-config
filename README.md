## ZMK
This is the zmk config for my corne.  

I figure it would be a good place to put some TODOs for improvement.  

### TODO
1. Homerow mod and combo
   - Right now I have 'rs' on homerow for both modifiers and tab combo. If both keys are pressed down (for long enough time), modifiers are the expected behavior. But now it's hitting tabs on repeat.
